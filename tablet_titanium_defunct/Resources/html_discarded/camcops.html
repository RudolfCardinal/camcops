  <h1>Web site</h1>

  <p>The primary CamCOPS web site is at <a href=
  "http://www.camcops.org/">www.camcops.org</a>.</p>

  <h1>Copyright and intellectual property rights</h1>

  <p><b>You must distinguish between CamCOPS code itself, and the tasks
  contained in and distributed with it.</b></p>

  <h2>CamCOPS itself</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>CamCOPS is copyright © Rudolf Cardinal, the University of Cambridge,
    and the Wellcome Trust.</li>

    <li>It is free, open-source, and made available under the <a href=
    "http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0">Apache License 2.0</a>.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Tasks, scales, and questionnaires distributed with CamCOPS</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>CamCOPS comes with several tasks, scales, and questionnaires.</li>

    <li>Some were created for CamCOPS and have the same copyright/licensing
    arrangements as CamCOPS itself (see above).</li>

    <li>Some are in the public domain.</li>

    <li><b>Some are subject to copyright, and are included with the prior or
    explicit permission of the copyright holder.</b></li>

    <li>Some tasks may only be used in certain settings (e.g. only in a
    non-commercial environment). CamCOPS enforces this by requiring you to
    specify the environment you are working in (see “<i>Settings</i>” →
    “<i>Configure settings determining intellectual property (IP)
    permissions</i>”).</li>

    <li><b>For details on each task, see the “<i>Task information</i>” option
    on each task’s menu.</b></li>
  </ul>

  <h1>Your CamCOPS server</h1>

  <ul>
    <li>CamCOPS will operate offline on your tablet, and you can view simple
    summaries of your tasks there.</li>

    <li>You should set up a server to receive data from your CamCOPS tablet(s).

      <ul>
        <li>The simplest way (involving only free software) is to set up a
        Linux (e.g. Ubuntu) computer with an Apache web server and a MySQL
        database (plus the Python and Perl interpreters that come with most
        Linux distributions) – collectively known as a LAMP stack.</li>

        <li>You must also obtain (or create for free) an HTTPS certificate, and
        configure your web server to do all its CamCOPS work via HTTPS only
        (not HTTP), so that your information is always encrypted in transit
        from the tablets to your server. CamCOPS will not use unencrypted
        links.</li>

        <li>Then, there are a few CamCOPS scripts that you can add to your web
        server, so that it can receive data from your tablets, and offer a
        simple web front end so you can retrieve nice-looking PDFs of your
        tasks.</li>

        <li>For more advanced analysis, you can then use the MySQL database
        directly.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Having set up your server, you should point your tablet(s) to it (see
    “<i>Settings</i>” → “<i>Configure server settings</i>”).</li>

    <li>For details, see the CamCOPS website.</li>
  </ul>

  <h1>Locked and privileged modes</h1>

  <ul>
    <li>When you first install CamCOPS, you should enter access codes (see
    “<i>Settings</i>” → “<i>Set access codes</i>”).</li>

    <li>At the top right of a screen is an unlocked padlock (indicating
    Unlocked Mode), a locked padlock (indicating Locked Mode), or two unlocked
    padlocks (Privileged Mode).</li>

    <li>Having selected a patient, you can lock your tablet by touching the
    padlock. You can then safely give it to that patient, and they will not be
    able to view other patients’ details.</li>

    <li>To unlock the tablet, touch the padlock and enter the code.</li>

    <li>Privileged mode (see “<i>Settings</i>”) is required to configure server
    settings and the like.</li>
  </ul>
