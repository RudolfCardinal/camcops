ANY PLATFORM: TRICKY/OTHER PEOPLE'S BUGS

-   It seems likely that QLabel::heightForWidth() sometimes gets heights wrong
    for some stylesheets, leading to excessive vertical height. See
    labelwordwrapwide.cpp (and to see the problem: try the demo QuMcqGrid).
    ... I think I've largely compensated for this, though.

-   The spinbox numerical entry fields are weak in terms of NULL values.
    This is an intrinsic weakness in QSpinBox and QDoubleSpinBox that works
    like this:
    - if you send a null value to a QSpinBox, it'll typically show its minimum
      value; for example, for the range 5-10, if you send it 0, it'll show 5.
    - If you then delete the "5" and retype "5", it doesn't generate any
      "changed" signals, either via its string or its integer signals.
      Therefore, this change isn't detected by the QuSpinBoxInteger or
      QuSpinBoxDouble framework. You have to delete it, replace it with
      something else, and re-enter it, for the change to be noticed and they
      yellow NULL indicator to disappear.
    There's no clear way round this, except that QuLineEditInteger and
    QuLineEditDouble do a better job.

ANDROID

-   Occasionally, copy/paste selection cursors appear on screen, far removed
    from the text they relate to. This is a Qt bug:
    - https://bugreports.qt.io/browse/QTBUG-58503
    Related Qt bugs:
    - https://bugreports.qt.io/browse/QTBUG-34867
    - https://bugreports.qt.io/browse/QTBUG-58700

-   Also potentially related to this: when LogBox or LogMessageBox are used
    with word_wrap = true on Android, the touch-to-scroll goes wrong.
    These classes use a QPlainTextEdit.

-   The arrow markers for the diagnostic trees don't scale with DPI.
    See discussion in diagnosticcodeselector.cpp; the problem is that it's not
    obvious how to set them programmatically. In fact, this is very hard
    indeed; see also my attempts in TreeViewProxyStyle and
    TreeViewControlDelegate, neither of which can make the changes where
    they're needed. Reported as a bug:
    - https://bugreports.qt.io/browse/QTBUG-62323
