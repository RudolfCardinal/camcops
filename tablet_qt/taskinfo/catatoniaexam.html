  <title>Catatonia examination technique</title>
</head>

<body>
  <h1>Standardized examination for catatonia</h1>

  <p>The method here forms the basis of both the 23-item Bush–Francis
  Catatonia Rating Scale (CRS) and the 14-item Catatonia Screening Instrument
  (CSI). The CRS measures the severity of 23 signs on a scale of 0–3; the CSI
  measures the presence or absence of the first 14 signs.</p>

  <p>Ratings for those scales are to be based only on observed behaviour during
  the examination, except for the items 'withdrawal' and 'autonomic
  abnormality', which can be based both on directly
  observed behaviour and on previously recorded findings.</p>

  <p>In general, items are only rated if clearly present..</p>
