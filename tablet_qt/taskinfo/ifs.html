    <li>Somewhat unclear.</li>

    <li>Torralva (2009, corrected 2010) article contains scale text.
    That article is marked copyright &copy; 2009 INS (International
    Neuropsychological Society).</li>

    <li>However, that article was then corrected for copyright reasons, as it
    contained (in its Appendix) material from the Wechsler Memory Scale –
    Revised, for which the copyright is owned by NCS Pearson Inc.; that part
    was removed in the corrected version.</li>

    <li>The removed text was the instructions for the “digits backward”
    task.</li>

    <li>For the moment, only a skeleton task (with no task text) is included in
    CamCOPS.</li>
