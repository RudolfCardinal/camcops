    <li>“As you know, we are happy for the ACE to be used widely and modified
    for use in other formats, such as the iPad. The guiding principle of the
    ACE-III is that it is free for users and we wish therefore that
    disseminiation in other forms, such as the tablet, also remains free.”

    Rudolf Cardinal, 28 Oct 2012)</li>
