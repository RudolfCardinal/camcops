  <h2>Instructions</h2>

  <p>From the NART-R source:</p>

  <h3>Instructions for administering and scoring the NART-R</h3>

  <p>The NART-R is administered by giving the subject the list of
  61<sup>*</sup> words and asking him to read each word aloud: <i>“I want you
  to read slowly down this list of words starting here [indicate “DEBT”
  <sup>*</sup>] and continuing down this column and on to the next. I must warn
  you that there are many words that you probably won’t recognize, in fact most
  people don’t know them, so just guess at these, O.K.? Go ahead.”</i></p>

  <p>The subject should be encouraged to guess, and all responses should be
  reinforced (“good”, “that’s fine”, etc.). The subject may change a response
  if he wishes to do so, but if more than one version is given the subject must
  decide which is his final choice. No time limit is imposed. If the subject
  becomes frustrated, encourage him to continue to the end. At the end of the
  task, if the subject wants more information, the examiner should feel free to
  tell the subject the correct pronunciation and/or meaning of each word
  (definitions are shown below). If a subject asks for feedback in the middle
  of the task, simply tell him that you have to wait until he reaches the end
  of the task.</p>

  <p>The examiner indicates on the scoring form whether or not each word was
  pronounced correctly. It is OK to stop the subject and ask him to slow down
  if he is reading the words too quickly. Subjects should not be penalized for
  minor variations from the exact pronunciation: because of the irregular,
  non-phonetic, spelling of the words, it should be obvious when the subject is
  not familiar with the written form of the target word. At the end of the
  task, sum the number of errors and the number of correct items. It is very
  important the subject attempt <b>all</b> of the items. If the subject refuses
  to complete the entire task, <b>do not</b> score the task.</p>

  <p><sup>*</sup> <i>First word is DEBT in the NART-R but CHORD in the NART.
  There are 61 words in the NART-R but 50 in the NART.</i></p>
