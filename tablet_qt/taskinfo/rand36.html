  <h1>RAND 36-Item Short Form Health Survey 1.0</h1>

  <h2>History and guide</h2>

  <p>Developed at RAND as part of the Medical Outcomes Study.</p>

  <p><b>Note:</b></p>

  <ul>
    <li>The RAND 36-Item Health Survey (as here, distributed by RAND) contains
    the same items as the MOS SF-36® (distributed by <a href=
    "http://www.outcomes-trust.org/instruments.htm#SF-36">Medical Outcomes
    Trust / MOS Trust Inc.</a>), but has a slightly different scoring system.
    See Hays RD et al. (1993), <a href=
    "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8275167">PMID 8275167</a>.</li>

    <li>A later, commercial version exists, the SF-36v2™; see <a href=
    "http://www.sf-36.org/">http://www.sf-36.org/</a>.</li>

    <li>RAND use “SF-36” in the description of their version, but because of
    the <a href=
    "http://tess2.uspto.gov/bin/gate.exe?f=login&amp;p_lang=english&amp;p_d=trmk">
    trademark</a>, we use “RAND-36”.</li>
