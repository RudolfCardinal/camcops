  <h2>Source</h2>

  <p>Guy (1976), as above.</p>

  <p>A trivial modification has been made: questions are asked about
  therapeutic effect and side effects separately, and are then combined to give
  the same score as the original CGI method (which required a simultaneous
  rating on those two dimensions).</p>
