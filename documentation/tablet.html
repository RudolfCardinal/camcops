  <h1>Usernames and passwords in CamCOPS</h1>

  <p>In a low-security environment, you’ll be your own administrator. In a
  high-security environment, we’ll distinguish the user (“clinician”) from the
  technical security person (“administrator”).</p>

  <p>CamCOPS uses the following usernames and passwords:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>TABLET PASSWORD. Your tablet will need a password to unlock it.</li>

    <li>CAMCOPS APP PASSWORD. The CamCOPS application will also need a password
    to unlock it.</li>

    <li>CAMCOPS PRIVILEGED-MODE PASSWORD. This password unlocks the deep dark
    secrets of the app. Whoever has this can, for example, change the server
    that the app sends its data to. In a high-security environment, this
    password is typically known to the administrator, but not the
    clinician.</li>

    <li>CAMCOPS SERVER USERNAME and CAMCOPS SERVER PASSWORD. These authenticate
    a user (who might be a clinician or an administrator) to the web interface,
    hosted by the CamCOPS server. You may use this username/password in these
    circumstances:

      <ol>
        <li>The CamCOPS app needs to know a username/password combination to
        register with a new server. (Registration is typically done by the
        administrator using their username/password.)</li>

        <li>The CamCOPS app needs to know a username/password combination to
        upload data to the server. (Uploading is typically done by the
        clinician using their username/password. The app may or may not be
        allowed to store the password — that’s a local security policy decision
        — but it will store the username.)</li>

        <li>You will type in your username and password to access the CamCOPS
        web viewer. This interface is used primarily to view tasks that have
        been uploaded from tablets. Administrators can also use this interface
        to create or edit authorized users.</li>
      </ol>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h1>Configuring your tablet before using CamCOPS</h1>

  <h2>iPad</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Set up appropriate security on your tablet. For a research environment
    with no patient-identifiable data, this may involve no work. But for a
    secure environment:

      <ul>
        <li>Home → Settings → General → Passcode Lock

          <ul>
            <li>... → Simple passcode = OFF. Why? Because 4-digit passcodes are
            weak; use a strong password (<a href="http://xkcd.com/936/">what’s
            a strong password?</a>; <a href=
            "https://xato.net/passwords/analyzing-the-xkcd-comic/#.UpdCtB8Sqak">
            more on strong passwords</a>), and don’t forget it! We’ll call this
            the TABLET PASSWORD.</li>

            <li>... → Turn passcode on</li>

            <li>... → Require passcode = immediately.</li>

            <li>... → Erase data = ON (which will erase all data on the iPad
            after 10 failed passcode attempts).</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>Setting a passcode lock <a href=
      "http://support.apple.com/kb/ht4175">automatically encrypts data on the
      iPad</a> <sup>[1]</sup>.
    </li>

    <li>Install CamCOPS; see the <a href="../download/index.html">download</a>
    page.</li>
  </ul>

  app storage is separate from the keychain.</i></p>

  <h2>Android</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Set up appropriate security on your tablet. For a research environment
    with no patient-identifiable data, this may involve no work. But for a
    secure environment:

      <ul>
        <li>Plug in the tablet; charge its battery fully. (Encryption takes a
        while and requires a charged tablet that’s plugged in.)</li>

        <li>Settings → Security → Screen lock → Password</li>

        <li>Enter a strong password (<a href="http://xkcd.com/936/">what’s a
        strong password?</a>; <a href=
        "https://xato.net/passwords/analyzing-the-xkcd-comic/#.UpdCtB8Sqak">more
        on strong passwords</a>), and don’t forget it! We’ll call this the
        TABLET PASSWORD.</li>

        <li>Settings → Security → Encryption → Encrypt tablet → Encrypt
        tablet</li>

        <li>... which may take a while.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Install CamCOPS; see the <a href="../download/index.html">download</a>
    page</li>
  </ul>

  <h1>Configuring CamCOPS before using it</h1>

  <p><b>Using the CamCOPS server’s web interface, the administrator
  should:</b></p>

  <ul>
    <li>Create a username and password for the new user. Normal settings:

      <ul>
        <li>May use web viewer? Almost certainly YES.</li>

        <li>May view other users’ records? Almost certainly YES, for clinical
        safety reasons.</li>

        <li>Sees all patients’ records when unfiltered? Almost certainly NO,
        for confidentiality reasons.</li>

        <li>May upload data? YES.</li>

        <li>May manage users? NO; that’s for administrators.</li>

        <li>May register tablet devices? Choose NO in a high-security
        environment (but this means you will have to register the tablet for
        the user).</li>

        <li>May use webstorage? Currently this is a feature in beta testing;
        the security-conscious should choose NO for now.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p><b>On the tablet, the administrator should:</b></p>

  <ol>
    <li>Touch the padlock (top right) to unlock. (The first time CamCOPS is
    run, there will be no lock passwords; you need to set them, as below.)</li>

    <li>Settings → Set privileged mode (the icon at the top right will now show
    a golden pair of padlocks).</li>

    <li>Settings → Change privileged-mode password → enter a password for this
    tablet; do NOT tell the clinician; keep it in your Administrator’s
    Safe.</li>

    <li>Settings → Change app password → enter a starting password for the
    clinician (their CAMCOPS APP PASSWORD); tell the clinician what this
    is.</li>

    <li>Settings → Server settings

      <ul>
        <li>Set the server hostname</li>

        <li>Set the server path</li>

        <li>Ensure “Validate SSL certificates?” is set to “Yes”.</li>

        <li>Choose the “Store user’s server password?” option. Your users will
        probably thank you for choosing “Yes”. The especially
        security-conscious may want “No”. (This setting determines whether the
        tablet will store an encrypted version of the user’s password; it
        allows the user to unlock CamCOPS with their CamCOPS app password, but
        then not to have to re-enter their CamCOPS server password each time
        they upload.)</li>

        <li>Other values can typically be left as the default.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>Assuming you will not allow the user to register devices with the
    server, you’ll have to do it yourself:

      <ol>
        <li>Settings → User settings → Username: your <b>administrative</b>
        CAMCOPS SERVER USERNAME. (Don’t enter a password here, even if you
        allow users to store their password; you don’t want your
        administrator’s password saved.)</li>

        <li>Settings → Register with server. (It will ask for your
        administrative CAMCOPS SERVER PASSWORD, and then should initiate
        communication with the server, and succeed). <b>Until registration has
        succeeded, the app will not be able to upload.</b></li>

        <li><i>Optionally, to be nice to the user:</i> Settings → User settings
        → Username: the <b>clinician’s</b> CAMCOPS SERVER USERNAME</li>
      </ol>
    </li>

    <li>Ensure you haven’t accidentally stored your administrative password in
    the app (Settings → User settings). If you followed the instructions above,
    you won’t have done.</li>

    <li>Touch the padlock until it shows the red, locked icon. You can now give
    the tablet to your clinician.</li>
  </ol>

  <p><b>The clinician should then:</b></p>

  <ul>
    <li>If the whole tablet is locked, unlock it with the TABLET PASSWORD.</li>

    <li>Touch the padlock to unlock. You will need your CAMCOPS APP PASSWORD,
    supplied to you by your administrator.</li>

    <li>Settings → Change app password → change the password to a strong
    password that you like (<a href="http://xkcd.com/936/">what’s a strong
    password?</a>; <a href=
    "https://xato.net/passwords/analyzing-the-xkcd-comic/#.UpdCtB8Sqak">more on
    strong passwords</a>). Remember it.</li>

    <li>Settings → Intellectual property (IP) permissions → answer all the
    questions <a href="ip.html">honestly</a>.</li>

    <li>Settings → User settings

      <ul>
        <li>Device friendly name: e.g. “Joe Smith’s LPS iPad”.</li>

        <li>Username on server: your CAMCOPS SERVER USERNAME, supplied to you
        by your administrator.</li>

        <li><i>(If your administrator has allowed you to store your server
        password:)</i> Password on server: your CAMCOPS SERVER PASSWORD,
        supplied to you by your administrator.</li>

        <li><b>Default clinician’s specialty/name/professional
        registration/post/contact details:</b> set values that you would
        typically enter in patients’ notes. For example, a UK doctor might
        have: specialty = "Liaison psychiatry"; name = "Dr John Doe";
        professional registration = "GMC# 123456"; post = "Consultant"; contact
        details = "extension 1234; bleep 5678".</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p><i>The <b>clinician’s name</b> that you enter will be automatically
  processed into prefix/forename/surname components for HL-7 diagnosis (DG1)
  segments, if you use a recognized format. Recognized formats include, for
  example, Prefix Forename Surname (where prefix is Dr, Prof, Miss, Mrs, Ms,
  Mr, Sr, with or without full stops); Forename Surname; Surname, Forename. If
  the software doesn’t recognize the format, it will put the whole name
  verbatim into the surname field for DG-1 codes.</i></p>

  <p>Good to go! See <a href="app.html">using the tablet app</a>.</p>

  <h1>Other tablet settings that can affect CamCOPS</h1>
  <h2>Turn off auditory interruptions</h2>
  <p>If beeps and buzzes from other apps would interfere with your use of
  CamCOPS, disable them.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>For Android: Android Settings → Sound → Volume; then turn off things
    like “Ringtone” (for phones), “Notifications”, and “System”.</li>
    <li>For iOS: iOS Settings → Notifications, and turn “Sounds” off.</li>
  </ul>

  <h1>Other app settings</h1>

  <h4>Questionnaire font size</h4>

  <ul>
    <li>Settings → Questionnaire font size → choose a font size that you
    like.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Upload after each task is complete?</h4>

  <ul>
    <li>Settings → User settings → Offer to upload every time a task is
    edited?</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Multiline text editing behaviour</h4>

  <ul>
    <li>Settings → User settings → Make multiline text fields appear with a
    fixed height while editing?</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Choose NO for the text boxes to auto-size whilst editing (which looks
  nicer). Choose YES if this makes editing too slow (e.g. on an iPad).
  Multiline text fields will always auto-size in facsimile mode, for
  viewing.</p>

  <h4>Send analytics to CamCOPS base?</h4>

  <ul>
    <li>Settings → Server settings → Send analytics to CamCOPS base?</li>
  </ul>

  <p>This sends information back to the CamCOPS base in Cambridge, when CamCOPS
  starts. This is the only information sent from the app anywhere except to the
  user-specified server. <i>NO PATIENT-IDENTIFIABLE, PER-PATIENT INFORMATION,
  OR TASK DETAILS ARE SENT.</i> This is what is sent:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>the fact that CamCOPS has started (allowing us to get an idea of how
    often it’s being used)</li>

    <li>the date/time, including timezone (allowing us to get a rough idea of
    its geographical distribution)</li>

    <li>the device ID, made up of the operating system type (which platforms
    are popular?) and the Titanium platform identifier (a random device-unique
    ID necessary for the task popularity question)</li>

    <li>the current server address (allowing us to get a rough idea of
    geographical/institutional distribution)</li>

    <li>the total number of records in each table (allowing us to get an idea
    of which tasks are popular)</li>

    <li>the CamCOPS/database version numbers (so we know if old versions are
    still in use, or if we can break them in an upgrade)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>We’d very much appreciate you saying yes; it allows us to support users
  better. Thank you!</p>
