Installing and configuring the client
=====================================

Hardware and operating system requirements
------------------------------------------

Desktop
~~~~~~~

There are no specific hardware requirements. The CamCOPS client runs on the
following desktop operating systems: Linux, Windows, and Mac OS/X.

Android
~~~~~~~

The minimum Android SDK version is 16, meaning Android 4.1 (‘Jelly Bean’,
released in 2012). For development, we have used:

- Asus Transformer Prime TF201 (2011, running Android 4.1.1) — nice keyboard
  with an extra battery in it, though WiFi only with no 3G connection.

- Sony Xperia Z2 tablet (2014; available in WiFi and 3G versions), with
  Bluetooth keyboard.

iOS
~~~

For iOS, we suggest an iPad or iPad mini; iPhones are probably just too small.
CamCOPS has been tested on hardware as slow as an iPad 2 (2011) and works fine.
A physical (e.g. Bluetooth) keyboard is useful if you plan on using the
clinical clerking aspects or other tasks requiring significant typing. Not much
information is stored on the tablet (it’s shipped periodically to the server)
so we think any model of iPad will do.
