  <h1>Typical costs</h1>

  <p>We have set up CamCOPS in the low-cost environment of a research-active
  university that provides network support, with WiFi tablet access, and the
  high-cost environment of an NHS institution with a secure VPN (including 3G
  and WiFi access) and outsourced IT support. Here are some representative
  incremental costs, in 2013, from those environments.</p>
