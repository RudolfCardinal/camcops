RECORDING
    COMPUTER AUDIO 3.5mm PORTS:
        - top row: all speaker outputs
        - bottom row: centre is headphones; to left (as viewed from back of computer) is microphone; to right is line in.
        - comparison of microphone/line-in: definitely better on microphone port
    - microphone:
        in Audacity, select ALSA / pulse / pulse: Rear Mic:0 / 2 (Stereo) Input Channels
        in Ubuntu's sound settings: Input Devices > Built-in Audio Analogue Stereo / Rear Microphone
                                    > set level [L/R locked together] so there's no background hum -- adjust WHILE RECORDING in Audacity
            - quite good at 40%
            - actually, then you have to amplify - leave at 100%
    - PLACE THE MICROPHONE AWAY FROM THE MONITORS...
      MOVE COMPUTER AWAY FROM THE WALL A BIT...
    - Audacity Edit > Preferences > Recording > software playthrough (temporarily) -- allows adjustment
    
    - record
    - split stereo track to mono
    - best noise removal is the Noise Removal plugin (give it plenty of baseline to work with); good at default settings
        http://manual.audacityteam.org/man/Noise_Removal
        defaults: noise reduction 24 dB, sensitivity 0 dB, frequency smoothing 150 Hz, attack/decay time 0.15 s
        try with preview mode, esp. with "isolate"
        trying: 40 dB, sensitivity 3 dB, f.s. 150 Hz, a/d.t. 0.15 s

CUES: A_cue_00.wav to A_cue_07.wav
    need 8 cues, 100 ms, fade in/out over 4ms, easily distinguishable, different from target (i.e. no simple tones, no words)

TARGET 0 (nonverbal): A_target_0.wav
    ... file will begin simultaneously with the background and last same time (1s)
    ... fade in/out over same duration as background (50ms)
    ... amplitude... a not-crazy maximum, e.g. 0.1
    ... sine wave
    ... 440 Hz

TARGET 1 (verbal): A_target_1.wav
    ... will begin simultaneously with the background
    ... so allow 50ms before noise starts
    ... short word
        word choice: nothing like a number (we'll be asking for a rating)
                     avoid HF components, hard to remove noise

    ... "moon"
    ... if necessary (not!) fade out the (just few ms) at the end of the clip, so there isn't an impulse sound
    ... amplify by 10 dB -- test against background, so easily audible when both at full volume

TARGET BACKGROUND: A_background.wav
    white noise

    amplitude: see below (ended up with 0.0375)
    duration = 1 s (total)
    fade in over 50 ms:
        - use the selection toolbar (bottom of the screen) to select from 0 to 4 ms: http://manual.audacityteam.org/man/Audacity_Selection
          ... if the fade in reselects the whole thing, try clicking *within* the waveform, not on the bar above it, before typing in the selection bar

SOUND LEVELS
    - we want the tablet at 100%, since it's hard to be accurate at other levels
        Android: volumes (1) music/video/games/other media 100%; (2) notifications 0%; (3) alarms 0%
    - so then set the white noise so that it's not uncomfortable on the tablet at 100%
        ... amplitude 0.05 gives 62.5 dB(A) max (placing the sound meter in the Audio-Technica headphones), very consistently (settings: A, Lo, Fast, then Max)
        ... note that dB(A) is db(SPL) weighted for a human ear response
        ... I'd really like something closer to 60 dB(A) -- so a -2.5 dB change means a power change of (10 ^ -0.25) = 0.562, or an amplitude change of sqrt(power change) = 0.7498...
            ... so let's try an amplitude in Audacity of 0.05 * 0.75 = 0.0375
        ... spot on! 60.0 dB(A). Oh, well, mean 59.3.
    - then (for convenient editing) set the computer's sound volume so the same sound, through the same headphones, also gives ~60 dB(A) -- this is at 44%.
    - Note that a reduction in amplitude from 1.0 to 0.01 gives a power change of 10^-4, or a dB change of 10 * -4 = -40.
    - halving amplitude => power x 0.25 => dB change 10 * log10(0.25) = -6
    - WAV files are 16-bit (signed), i.e. 15 bit, i.e. +/-32,768 approx. (+/- 2^15), so the resolution on the positive scale of 0-1 is 0.00003.
