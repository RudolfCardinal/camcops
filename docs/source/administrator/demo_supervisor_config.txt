# =============================================================================
# Demonstration 'supervisor' (supervisord) config file for CamCOPS.
# Created by CamCOPS version 2.3.7 at 2019-11-22T11:49:01.954728+00:00.
# =============================================================================
    # - Supervisor is a system for controlling background processes running on
    #   UNIX-like operating systems. See:
    #       http://supervisord.org
    #
    # - On Ubuntu systems, you would typically install supervisor with
    #       sudo apt install supervisor
    #   and then save this file as
    #       /etc/supervisor/conf.d/camcops.conf
    #
    # - IF YOU EDIT THIS FILE, run:
    #       sudo service supervisor restart  # Ubuntu
    #       sudo service supervisord restart  # CentOS 6
    #
    # - TO MONITOR SUPERVISOR, run:
    #       sudo supervisorctl status
    #   ... or just "sudo supervisorctl" for an interactive prompt.
    #
    # NOTES ON THE SUPERVISOR CONFIG FILE AND ENVIRONMENT:
    #
    # - Indented lines are treated as continuation (even in commands; no need
    #   for end-of-line backslashes or similar).
    # - The downside of that is that indented comment blocks can join onto your
    #   commands! Beware that.
    # - You can't put quotes around the directory variable
    #   (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/10653590).
    # - Python programs that are installed within a Python virtual environment
    #   automatically use the virtualenv's copy of Python via their shebang;
    #   you do not need to specify that by hand, nor the PYTHONPATH.
    # - The "environment" setting sets the OS environment. The "--env"
    #   parameter to gunicorn, if you use it, sets the WSGI environment.
    # - Creating a group (see below; a.k.a. a "heterogeneous process group")
    #   allows you to control all parts of CamCOPS together, as "camcops" in
    #   this example (see
    #   http://supervisord.org/configuration.html#group-x-section-settings).
    #   Thus, you can do, for example:
    #       sudo supervisorctl start camcops:*
    #
    # SPECIFIC EXTRA NOTES FOR CAMCOPS:
    #
    # - The MPLCONFIGDIR environment variable specifies a cache directory for
    #   matplotlib, which greatly speeds up its subsequent loading.
    # - The typical "web server" user is "www-data" under Ubuntu Linux and
    #   "apache" under CentOS.
