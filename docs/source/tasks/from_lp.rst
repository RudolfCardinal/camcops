This is part of the FROM-LP framework.

.. _from_lp:

The FROM-LP framework
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**The FROM-LP generic measures are:**

*Process*

- a measure of response time;

- IRAC: Identify and Rate the Aim of the Contact (Trigwell P, 2014a).

*Outcomes (clinician-rated)*

- CGI-I: Clinical Global Impression – Improvement scale; see :ref:`CGI-I
  <cgi_i>`.

*Outcomes (patient-rated)*

- :ref:`CORE-10 <core10>`

*Patient satisfaction*

- :ref:`Patient Satisfaction Scale (PSS) <pss>` (Persaud A et al. 2008).

- :ref:`Friends and Family Test (FFT) <fft>` (Department of Health, 2012).

*Referrer satisfaction*

- Referrer Satisfaction Scale (RSS) (Trigwell P, 2014b, after Persaud A et al.
  2008). (CamCOPS supports two versions of the RSS: a :ref:`patient-specific
  version <rss_patient_specific>` and a :ref:`survey version <rss_survey>`.)

**The FROM-LP condition-specific measures are:**

- Dementia: the :ref:`ACE-R <ace_r>`. (In CamCOPS, see the :ref:`ACE-III
  <ace3>` instead.)

- Depressive disorders: the :ref:`PHQ-9 <phq9>`.

- Postnatal depression: the :ref:`EPDS <epds>`.

- Anxiety disorders: the :ref:`GAD-7 <gad7>`.

- Psychosis: the :ref:`HoNOS <honos>`.

- Alcohol: the :ref:`AUDIT-C <audit>`.

- Eating disorders: :ref:`BMI <bmi>`.

- Medically unexplained symptoms: the :ref:`EQ-5D-5L <eq5d5l>`.
