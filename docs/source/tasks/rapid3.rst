Routine Assessment of Patient Index Data (RAPID3)
-------------------------------------------------

.. include:: include_data_collection_plus_local_upgrade.rst

An index to assess and monitor patients with rheumatoid arthritis, without
formal joint counts.

RAPID3 includes an assessment of physical function, a patient global assessment
(PGA) for pain, and a PGA for global health.

To calculate RAPID3, the raw 0–3 score for physical function on the Health
Assessment Questionnaire is converted to 0–10 by multiplying by 3.33. Pain and
global estimate are assessed according to 10 cm visual analogue scales (VAS),
both scoring 0–10. The three 0–10 scores for physical function, pain VAS and
global VAS, are added together for a raw score of 0–30, and divided by 3 to give
an adjusted 0–10 score for comparison with other RAPID indices.
