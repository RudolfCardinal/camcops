-------------------------------------------

.. include:: include_data_collection_plus_local_upgrade.rst

20 questions rated on a 5-point scale ("yes, that is true" to "no, that is not
true").

Items are scored 1â€“5, with 10 positively phrased items reverse scored (items 2,
5, 9, 10, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18, 19). Total score calculated for 5 subscales:
general fatigue (items 1, 5, 12, 16), physical fatigue (items 2, 8, 14, 20),
reduced activity (items 7, 11, 13, 19), reduced motivation (items 3, 6, 10,
17), and mental fatigue (items 4, 9, 15, 18).
