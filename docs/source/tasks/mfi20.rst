Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI-20)
-------------------------------------------

.. include:: include_permission_contextual.rst

20 questions rated on a 5-point scale ("yes, that is true" to "no, that is not
true").

Items are scored 1–5, with 10 positively phrased items reverse scored (items 2,
5, 9, 10, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18, 19). Total score calculated for 5 subscales:
general fatigue (items 1, 5, 12, 16), physical fatigue (items 2, 8, 14, 20),
reduced activity (items 7, 11, 13, 19), reduced motivation (items 3, 6, 10,
17), and mental fatigue (items 4, 9, 15, 18).

    Subject: RE: MFI-20 permission

    Dear Joel,

    Thank you for your interest in incorporating the MFI in CamCops. You
    herewith have my permission to do so. Although I realize it depends on the
    trustworthiness of the end-user, I would prefer tasks including the MFI to
    be restricted to researchers en educators.

    I hope you helps.

    Kind regards,

    Ellen Smets

    Onderwerp: MFI-20 permission


    Dear Professor Smets,

    We are very interested in incorporating the Multidimensional Fatigue
    Inventory into CamCOPS (https://camcops.readthedocs.io/), and wonder
    whether you might permit this.

    Our understanding of the copyright status of the MFI-20 is:

    · It is copyrighted on the names of the authors.
    · It is free for academic use.

    May we ask if that is correct?

    CamCOPS is free and open-source software for capturing structured data
    relevant to psychiatry directly from patients, clinicians, and researchers.
    It was developed in the University of Cambridge, UK, and is in use for
    clinical and research purposes. Data flow is entirely under the control of
    the hosting institution. CamCOPS implements both open/free tasks and
    closed/restricted tasks using one of the following methods:

    · Open/free tasks are embedded into CamCOPS directly; this is our preferred
      method.

    · Some tasks may be permitted to some institutions but not others. These
      can be implemented via a public “skeleton” in CamCOPS (with no task
      content) and a “plugin” containing the task content (e.g. text for a
      questionnaire) that licensed users can add to their CamCOPS installation,
      converting the skeleton into a fully working copy.

    · Some closed tasks do not permit electronic reproduction. Sometimes, these
      still benefit from an electronic data capture “skeleton” that never
      includes task content, but is still preferable to paper capture and
      manual (laborious and error-prone) transcription. The electronic skeleton
      can then be used in conjunction with a licensed paper copy of the task.

    In addition, all CamCOPS tasks can be restricted if necessary according to
    flags that the end user can set: clinical use? Research use? Educational
    use? Commercial use? For example, a task can be restricted to noncommercial
    use only (though this relies on end-user honesty and end-user liability).

    Would it be permissible for us to incorporate the MFI-20 into CamCOPS,
    using one of the above methods? We’d be most grateful.

    Thank you for your time in considering this. If you have any questions or
    if there is anything I can clarify, please just let me know.

    Yours sincerely,

    Joel Parkinson
