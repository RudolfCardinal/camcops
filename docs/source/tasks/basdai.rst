Six numerical rating scales.

    A. Add scores for questions 1 – 4

**TO BE ESTABLISHED.** Mapi Trust website states "This questionnaire is in the
 public domain."

Braun et al. (2014, p. S-100) state "Another major difference between BASDAI and
ASDAS is that the latter is entirely in the public domain while the BASDAI,
since 2011, is only free of charge to academic users while industry has to pay
because of a copyright held by A. Calin represented by the MAPI trust (Mapi
Research Trust, 27 rue de la Villette, 69003 Lyon, France)
