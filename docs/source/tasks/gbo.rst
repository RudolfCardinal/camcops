.. _gbo_gres:

Goal-Based Outcomes -- Goal Record Sheet (GBO-GReS)
---------------------------------------------------

For recording goals of therapy. Part of the :ref:`GBO <gbo>` family.

Minor change to the original: "patient/service user" replaces "child/young
person", since this is not specific to paediatric work.
"Practitioner/clinician" also introduced as an option for the "who completed
the form?" question.
