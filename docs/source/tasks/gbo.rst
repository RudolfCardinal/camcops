Goals and Goal-Based Outcomes (GBO)
-----------------------------------

A collection of sub-tasks as follows.

.. _gbo_gres:

Goal-Based Outcomes -- Goal Record Sheet (GBO-GReS)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For recording goals of therapy.

.. _gbo_gprs:

Goal-Based Outcomes -- Goal Progress Sheet (GBO-GPrS)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. include:: include_under_development.rst

For recording progress towards the goals.

Goal-Based Outcomes -- Goal Progress Chart
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Not implemented** because this is a visual chronological track of information
contained in the Goal Rating Sheet, and CamCOPS can track that information in
other ways.
