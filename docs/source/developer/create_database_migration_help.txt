usage: create_database_migration.py [-h] [--verbose] message

Create database revision. Note:

- The config used will be that from the environment variable
  CAMCOPS_CONFIG_FILE (currently '/home/rudolf/Documents/code/camcops/working_l
  ocal_secret/camcops_py3_test.ini').

- Alembic compares (a) the current state of the DATABASE to (b) the state of
  the SQLAlchemy metadata (i.e. the CODE). It creates a migration file to
  change the database to match the code.

- Accordingly, in the rare event of wanting to do a fresh start, you need an
  *empty* database.

- More commonly, you want a database that is synced to a specific Alembic
  version (with the correct structure, and the correct version in the
  alembic_version table). If you have made manual changes, such that the actual
  database structure doesn't match the structure that Alembic expects based on
  that version, there's likely to be trouble.

positional arguments:
  message     Revision message

optional arguments:
  -h, --help  show this help message and exit
  --verbose   Be verbose
