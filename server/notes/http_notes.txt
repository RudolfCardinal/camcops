Q.  Why aren't my browser tabs being loaded in parallel?

A.  Try this:
    (*) enable DEBUG_REQUEST_CREATION in cc_request.py
    (*) run "camcops serve" to use CherryPy in threaded mode
    (*) fire up lots of tabs (e.g. to view a large task list); watch them
        load in serial (sometimes, but not always, reusing the same thread);
         true in Chrome and Firefox
    (*) fire up a Chrome normal + a Chrome private + a Firefox instance (etc.)
        and refresh them all fast; watch them load in parallel;
    (*) realize that this is a browser-side problem!

    ... i.e. not the server's problem.
