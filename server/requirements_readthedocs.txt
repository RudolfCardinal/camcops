# server/requirements_readthedocs.txt

# Point readthedocs towards setup.py.
# As per https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/faq.html
# (1) Configure it to use "server/requirements_readthedocs.txt" as a
#     requirements file.
# (2) From this file, point to the relative path of setup.py:

# .  # doesn't work
server/

# Since "." fails and "server/" works, I am sceptical of the FAQ's comments
# about paths being relative to this file...

# Also,
# (3) Turn off "Install your project inside a virtualenv using setup.py
#     install"; the requirements-based method supersedes that (by redirecting
#     to setup.py directly).
