Sube Banerjee (author and principal investigator) to Rudolf Cardinal, 2015-06-25:

"If this is product/system that is free to use I would have no problem in DEMQOL
and DEMQOL-Proxy being included.
1. There is no licence needed or need to register its use.  It is a free to use
   system but we assert copyright so no-one else does.
2. There are no costs due for its use.
3. There is a manual which is available on our website
   http://www.bsms.ac.uk/research/our-researchers/sube-banerjee/demqol/
   which also includes the instruments.
4. The information on scoring is contained in the DEMQOL manual and monograph
   which are available freely on our website.
5. You can generate your own electronic format but we would not cede copyright
   on the instrument."</pre>
