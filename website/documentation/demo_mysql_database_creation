# First, from the Linux command line, log in to MySQL as root:

mysql --host=127.0.0.1 --port=3306 --user=root --password
# ... or the usual short form: mysql -u root -p

# Create the database:

CREATE DATABASE camcops;

# Ideally, create another user that only has access to the CamCOPS database.
# You should do this, so that you donâ€™t use the root account unnecessarily.

GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON camcops.* TO 'YYYYYY_REPLACE_ME'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'ZZZZZZ_REPLACE_ME';

# For future use: if you plan to explore your database directly for analysis,
# you may want to create a read-only user. Though it may not be ideal (check:
# are you happy the user can see the audit trail?), you can create a user with
# read-only access to the entire database like this:

GRANT SELECT camcops.* TO 'QQQQQQ_REPLACE_ME'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'PPPPPP_REPLACE_ME';

# All done. Quit MySQL:

exit
