  <h1>General</h1>

  <ul>
    <li>Begin by logging in.</li>

    <li><b><i>Hint:</i></b> Clicking on the CamCOPS logo (top left) will return
    you to the main menu at all times.</li>

    <li>The database’s title and your username are always shown.</li>

    <li>See also the <a href="tour.html">tour</a>.</li>
  </ul>

  <h1>Main data views</h1>

  <h2>View tasks</h2>

  <p>This screen shows you a set of filters, and matching tasks. You can filter
  by:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>any one of the ID numbers;</li>

    <li>surname, forename, DOB, sex;</li>

    <li>task type;</li>

    <li>whether the task was properly completed;</li>

    <li>the device and/or user that uploaded the task;</li>

    <li>a start and/or end date, to constrain the tasks to a date range;</li>

    <li>any text found in the fields for the task.

      <ul>
        <li><b><i>Hint:</i></b> e.g. type in “paracetamol” to find clerkings
        that mention paracetamol anywhere.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>You may view each task in two formats:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <b>HTML:</b> this will be served to you fastest, so is useful for quick
      viewing, but is <b>not</b> suitable for printing in a clinical
      environment (because it won’t have patient identifiers on each page).

      <ul>
        <li><b><i>Hint:</i></b> At the bottom of the HTML, there will be a link
        to view the PDF <i>(and perhaps links to view older/newer versions of
        the same task, if it has been edited and re-uploaded; the newest will
        always be shown first)</i>.</li>
        <li><i>Superusers have some additional options; see
        <a href="admin.html">Administration</a>.</i></li>
      </ul>
    </li>

    <li>
      <b>PDF:</b> this is suitable for printing, with identifiers on each page
      and a signature block for clinician-administered tasks (but it takes
      slightly longer to appear, as the server has to generate it first).

      <ul>
        <li>Here are some fictional examples: <a href=
        "dummy_task_1.pdf">PHQ-9</a>; <a href="dummy_task_2.pdf">psychiatric
        clerking</a> (albeit not a very good one!).</li>

        <li><b><i>Security hint:</i></b> some tablet browsers (e.g. Chrome for
        Android) save PDFs to the tablet by default. In that case, avoid
        viewing PDFs from that browser, or you’ll have to clean the
        patient-identifiable PDF off the tablet yourself.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Trackers</h2>

  <p>Trackers show quantities over time. They work like this:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>you choose a patient (using one of the ID numbers);</li>

    <li>optionally, you specify a start and/or end date;</li>

    <li>you choose one or more or all tasks (from those that support
    trackers);</li>

    <li>you specify an HTML (quick) or a PDF (print-formatted) view.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Then:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>All matching tasks are found. The tracker is generated.</li>

    <li>A <b>consistency check</b> is performed and added to the tracker to
    ensure that names, dates of birth, sexes, and all other ID numbers are
    consistent in all the tasks. <b>Beware</b> if the consistency check
    fails.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>A sample (fictional) tracker might look like this: <a href=
  "dummy_tracker.pdf">tracker PDF</a></p>

  <h2>Clinical text views</h2>

  <p>Whereas trackers show numerical information, clinical text views show
  clinically relevant textual information over time.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>you choose a patient (using one of the ID numbers);</li>

    <li>optionally, you specify a start and/or end date;</li>

    <li>you specify an HTML (quick) or a PDF (print-formatted) view.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Then:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>All matching tasks are found. The view is generated.</li>

    <li>A <b>consistency check</b> is performed and added to the tracker to
    ensure that names, dates of birth, sexes, and all other ID numbers are
    consistent in all the tasks. <b>Beware</b> if the consistency check
    fails.</li>

    <li>Tasks providing primary clinical text (e.g. diagnostic coding,
    psychiatric clerkings, and progress notes) show that information
    directly.</li>

    <li>Other tasks are noted in the chronology (and in the HTML version of the
    view, are hyperlinked to).</li>
  </ul>

  <p>A sample (fictional) clinical text view might look like this: <a href=
  "dummy_clinicaltextview.pdf">clinical text view PDF</a></p>

  <h1>Reports and data dumps <i>(for authorized users)</i></h1>

  <p>These options are not visible to most users.</p>

  <h2>Run reports</h2>

  <p>This provides a selection of built-in reports that you can run. Output is
  offered in HTML (for easy viewing) or tab-separated values (TSV) format for
  downloading and importing into spreadsheets and the like.</p>

  <h2>Basic research dump (fields and summaries)</h2>

  <p>This should be your starting point for a research dump. It’s not quite as
  powerful as the table/view data dump (see below), but it’s fairly
  comprehensive and much simpler to use. This option provides tab-separated
  value (TSV) files for each task (occasionally more than one per task, but
  usually one) in a ZIP file. By default it is restricted to current tasks
  (generally helpful as you don’t often want to view the edit history of all
  tasks). It incorporates patient and summary information for you, and the
  summaries are calculated “live” (unlike the table/view data dump, below,
  which requires you to regenerate summary tables first). So that’s also
  helpful. The configuration screen provides plenty of <b>explanation</b>,
  along with examples of how to import the resulting files into different
  software packages. You can choose to download:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Everything (all current records);</li>

    <li>those tasks specified by your current task filters (e.g. to restrict by
    patient, start/end date, and/or a single task type, etc.);</li>

    <li>just specific tasks (all current records for tasks that you
    choose).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Regenerate summary tables</h2>

  <p>This wipes and regenerates the <a href="summary_tables.html">summary
  tables</a>. Use it before dumping summary data with the table/view data dump
  option (below).</p>

  <h2>Dump table/view data</h2>

  <p>This allows authorized (highly privileged) users to download task data
  (with summary information), BLOBs (binary large objects, such as pictures),
  and patient information. The data is in the same format as the underlying
  database; that is, more powerful but more complex than the basic research
  dump. The SQL option allows you to recreate a copy of the database. With this
  option, views are downloaded as view definitions, just as in the original
  database. The TSV option downloads views as their content, which is often
  convenient. (Beware downloading the BLOBs. If you insist on downloading the
  BLOBs, they will be hex-encoded in the TSV format, with the MySQL
  <code>HEX()</code> function.)</p>

  <h2>Inspect table definitions (with or without view definitions)</h2>

  <p>These options allow you to view the table structure in use on the server.
  Most significantly, you can see the <b>field comments</b>, which give details
  of each field. Summary tables will only be included if you’ve generated them
  (see above).</p>

  <h1>Administrative options <i>(administrators only)</i></h1>

  <h2>Manage users</h2>

  <p>This allows administrators to add and delete users, reset their passwords,
  and edit their permissions.</p>

  <p>The permissions are:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><b>May use web viewer:</b> allows access to this web viewer. Usually
    YES.</li>

    <li><b>May view other users’ records:</b> allows the user to see tasks
    uploaded by others. Usually YES (beware saying NO: there is a significant
    clinical risk to being unable to see data!).</li>

    <li><b>Sees all patients’ records when unfiltered:</b> usually NO, for
    reasons of confidentiality; this is usually a superuser permission (though
    it may slow the webview down when no patient is selected).</li>

    <li><b>May upload data from tablet devices:</b> usually YES, or the user
    will be unable to upload data from tablets; however, NO may be correct for
    administrative/support staff.</li>

    <li><b>May manage users:</b> usually NO; this defines superuser
    authority.</li>

    <li><b>May register tablet devices:</b> depends on your local security
    policy (if you say NO, an administrator will have to register all users’
    tablets).</li>

    <li><b>May use mobileweb storage facility:</b> a facility in development,
    so say NO for now.</li>

    <li><b>May dump data:</b> ability to download raw data (typically YES for
    authorized researchers and NO for all others). Users with this permission
    can see raw data from the entire database regardless of other
    settings.</li>

    <li><b>May run reports:</b> ability to run prespecified reports (typically
    YES for selected clinicians and administrators). Users with this permission
    can run reports based on data from the entire database regardless of other
    settings.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Delete patient entirely</h2>

  <p>This completely destroys all data associated with a patient, as defined by
  a specific ID number. Use it e.g. when the records are old enough that they
  must be destroyed. Use it with great care!</p>

  <p><i><b>Note:</b> you can erase data for individual tasks, or apply a
  special note to all versions of a task, using the superuser options on that
  task’s HTML view. See <a href="admin.html">Administration</a>.</i></p>

  <h2>View audit trail</h2>

  <p>Explore the recent (or not so recent) audit log.</p>

  <h2>View HL7 message log</h2>

  <p>Shows recent tasks exported to different recipients via the HL7 or file
  export system. Each message is associated with a run (see below).</p>

  <h2>View HL7 run log</h2>

  <p>Shows recent HL7/file export runs. Note that many runs may send no
  messages, because there were no new tasks to export.</p>

  <h1>Other actions</h1>

  <h2>Show server identification policies</h2>

  <p>This displays:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>the server’s long and short descriptions of all the ID numbers — see
    <a href="id.html">Patient Identification</a></li>

    <li>the server’s “upload” and “finalize” ID policies — see <a href=
    "id.html">Patient Identification</a></li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Introspect source code <i>(if enabled)</i></h2>

  <p>If enabled on the server, this allows you to browse the <i>current</i>
  source code that the server is running, and the <i>most recent</i> tablet
  source code available when the server software was built. You may find this
  option helpful for understanding the internal workings of each task, e.g.
  scoring systems, or simply of interest. If your administrator has not enabled
  introspection, the source code is available via <a href=
  "https://www.camcops.org/">www.camcops.org</a>.</p>

  <h2>Change password</h2>
