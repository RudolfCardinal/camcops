    <li>Wing et al. (1999): published under Crown copyright.</li>

    <li>Personal communication from Mick James (HoNOS Advisor, Royal College of
    Psychiatrists) to Rudolf Cardinal, 2012-09-21: “The original R&amp;D was
    funded by the Department of Health and the status of the tool at first
    publication was indeed that it was Crown Copyright. A few years ago we were
    in discussion with the Australian Dept of Health and Ageing and New Zealand
    Health Ministry with the English Department of Health about the development
    of national initiatives mandating HoNOS and the Crown Copyright status was
    causing some legal difficulties so the DH suggested and organised that the
    copyright be legally transferred to the Royal College of Psychiatrists...
    So, current conditions are that copyright is now firmly with the
    College.”</li>

    <li>Permission to use the HoNOS scales in the current electronic test kit
    (open-source, for clinical and research purposes, without commercial
    marketing) granted by the Royal College of Psychiatrists, 2012-09-21

      <ul>
        <li>“Given the arrangements that you describe below for this we would
        be more than happy to grant permissions. Just needs to cite the RCPsych
        copyright and that will be fine.” (personal communication, Mick James
        [RCPsych] to Rudolf Cardinal, 2012-09-21)</li>

        <li>“I'd hoped to include the HoNOS (with its descriptors) in an
        open-source tablet app for use within our NHS (= CPFT) and research (=
        University of Cambridge) environments -- and, being open-source,
        potentially for others in similar settings. We would not be marketing
        it commercially in any way. Would it therefore be OK to include the
        HoNOS, citing RCPsych copyright and that we were including it with your
        permission?” (personal communication, Rudolf Cardinal to Mick James,
        2012-09-21)</li>
