  <h1>COPE Inventory (full and brief versions)</h1>

  <h2>History and guide</h2>

  <p>“The COPE Inventory was developed to assess a broad range of coping
  responses, several of which had an explicit basis in theory. The inventory
  includes some responses that are expected to be dysfunctional, as well as
  some that are expected to be functional. It also includes at least 2 pairs of
  polar­opposite tendencies. These were included because each scale is
  unipolar (the absence of this response does not imply the presence of its
  opposite), and because we think people engage in a wide range of coping
  during a given period, including both of each pair of opposites.</p>

  <p>“The items have been used in at least 3 formats. One is a
  "dispositional" or trait­like version in which respondents report the extent
  to which they usually do the things listed, when they are stressed. A second
  is a time­limited version in which respondents indicate the degree to which
  they actually did have each response during a particular period in the past.
  The third is a time-­limited version in which respondents indicate the degree
  to which they have been having each response during a period up to the
  present. The formats differ in their verb forms: the dispositional format is
  present tense, the situational­-past format is past tense, the third format
  is present tense progressive (I am ...) or present perfect (I have been
  ...).” <i>(Charles S. Carver, at
