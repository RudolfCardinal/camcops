  <title>Catatonia examination technique</title>
</head>

<body>
  <h1>Standardized examination for catatonia</h1>

  <p>The method described here is used to complete the 23-item Bush-Francis
  Catatonia Rating Scale (CRS) and the 14-item Catatonia Screening Instrument
  (CSI). Item definitions on the two scales are the same. The CRS measures the
  severity of 23 signs on a 0–3 scale, while the CSI measures only the presence
  or absence of the first 14 signs.</p>

  <p>Ratings are to be made solely on the basis of observed behaviour during
  the examination with the exception of completion of the items for
  'withdrawal' and 'autonomic abnormality', which may be based on directly
  observed behaviour and chart documentation.</p>

  <p>As a general rule, only rate items which are clearly present. If uncertain
  as to the presence of an item, rate the item as '0'.</p>
