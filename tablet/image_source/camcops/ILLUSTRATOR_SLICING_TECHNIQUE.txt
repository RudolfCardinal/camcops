- Don't use Illustrator's slices; they're inaccurate once you convert rectangles to slices.
- Ensure the whole board is an x-by-y grid.
- Ensure there's actual, coloured content at the edges (or it'll auto-trim and we'll slice wrongly).
- HAVE A GAP BETWEEN EACH ICON (the same size as the icons) - otherwise, Illustrator bleeds.
- Ensure black background is not visible; we want a transparent background.
- Save for Web; resize to the appropriate size (give or take a few pixels...)
- CURRENTLY: see SLICE_CAMCOPS_ICONS script for pixel sizes
  (each element is 96x96).
- Then run the slice script.

FOR SPLASHSCREEN:
- save the logo layer as logo_camcops.png
  ... e.g. 1000 wide (x approx. 180 high -- leave it at whatever it chooses with autoscaling)
  ... goes on the web site
- save all layers as sliceme.png
  ... run the script
