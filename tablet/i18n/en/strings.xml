CHARACTER SET NOTES
===============================================================================

On iOS, double-quotes must be escaped with a backslash (or no string will read).
Alternatively, and better, make all quotes left or right quotes.
Monaco font good for this. Helpful characters: ‘ ’ “ ” – — × • ≤ ≥ ≠ ± →

Use \n explicitly for newlines. Keep all strings on a single line (there is
inconsistency in how platforms deal with embedded newlines).

If at a single storey health setting, you could ask about a local landmark.</string>
<string name="ace3_attn_q_words">Tell: “I’m going to give you three words and I’d like you to repeat them after me: lemon, key and ball.”\nAfter subject repeats, say “Try to remember them because I’m going to ask you later”.</string>

For example, if I give you the letter ‘C’, you could give me words like ‘cat, cry, clock’ and so on. But, you can’t give me words like Catherine or Canada. Do you understand? Are you ready? You have one minute. The letter I want you to use is the letter ‘P’.”</string>
<string name="ace3_fluency_subheading_animals">Animals</string>
<string name="ace3_fluency_instruction_letters">First, record the total number of words that the participant generates. Then, count the number of correct words, which do not include: (1) repetitions, (2) perseverations (e.g., pay, paid, pays – correct = 1), (3) intrusions (i.e., words beginning with other letters), (4) proper names (i.e., names of people or places) and (5) plurals (e.g., pot, pots – total = 2, correct = 1).</string>

All types of animals are accepted, including insects, humans, prehistoric, extinct as well as mythical creatures (e.g., unicorn). If the participant misunderstands the instructions and perseverates by naming animals beginning with “p” (e.g., panda, possum, platypus etc), then reiterate to the participant that they should name animals beginning with any letter.</string>

<string name="ace3_instruction_famous">Allow surnames (e.g., “Obama”) and ask for a surname if only the first name is given (e.g., “Maggie”). If the full name given is incorrect (e.g., “June Thatcher”), then the score would be 0. If there has been a recent change in leaders, probe for the name of the outgoing politician.</string>
<string name="ace3_lang_q_command_1">Place a pencil and a piece of paper in front of the subject. As a practice trial, ask the subject to:</string>
<string name="ace3_lang_command_practice">“Pick up the pencil and then the paper.”</string>
<string name="ace3_lang_command1">“Place the paper on top of the pencil.”</string>
<string name="ace3_lang_command2">“Pick up the pencil but not the paper.”</string>
<string name="ace3_lang_command3">“Pass me the pencil after touching the paper.”</string>

<string name="ace3_lang_sentence2">“A stitch in time saves nine”</string>
<string name="ace3_lang_instruction_sentences_1">Do not accept partially correct repetitions (e.g., “all that glistens is not gold”).</string>
<string name="ace3_lang_instruction_sentences_2">Note: Following the repetition of each proverb, the examiner may wish to ask the participant “What does this proverb mean?” or “How would you explain this proverb to someone who has not heard it before?” This additional measure can aid the clinician in the qualitative assessment of verbal abstract thinking.</string>
<string name="ace3_advance_warning_1">On the next few pages:</string>
<string name="ace3_advance_warning_2">PICTURE IDENTIFICATION. Correct answers are: spoon; book; penguin; anchor; camel or dromedary; barrel, keg, or tub; crown; crocodile or alligator; harp; rhinoceros or rhino; kangaroo or wallaby; piano accordion, accordion or squeeze box.</string>

<string name="ace3_advance_warning_6">CLOCK SCORING: NUMBERS. 2 points if all numbers are included and well distributed within the circle. 1 point if all numbers are included but poorly distributed or outside of the circle. 0 points if not all numbers are included.</string>
<string name="ace3_advance_warning_7">CLOCK SCORING: HANDS. 2 points if both hands are well drawn, different lengths and placed on correct numbers (you might ask which one is the small and big one). 1 point if both placed on the correct numbers but wrong lengths OR 1 point if one hand is placed on the correct number and drawn with correct length OR 1 point if only one hand is drawn and placed at the correct number i.e. 5 for ‘ten past five’.</string>
<string name="ace3_advance_warning_8">LETTER RECOGNITION: FOR APHASIC PATIENTS. If the participant is unable to say the number of dots or letter name, allow them to write their answer. For the letter, allow them to say the correct letter sounds (e.g., “mmm”).</string>

Ask the patient whether there is anything in his or her mouth (such as gum or candy) and, if so, to remove it.\n2. Ask about the *current* condition of the patient’s teeth. Ask if he or she wears dentures. Ask whether teeth or dentures bother the patient *now*.\n3. Ask whether the patient notices any movements in his or her mouth, face, hands, or feet. f yes, ask the patient to describe them and to indicate to what extent they *currently* bother the patient or interfere with activities.\n4. Have the patient sit in chair with hands on knees, legs slightly apart, and feet flat on floor. (Look at the entire body for movements while the patient is in this position.)\n5. Ask the patient to sit with hands hanging unsupported -- if male, between his legs, if female and wearing a dress, hanging over her knees. (Observe hands and other body areas).\n6. Ask the patient to open his or her mouth. (Observe the tongue at rest within the mouth.) Do this twice.\n7. Ask the patient to protrude his or her tongue. (Observe abnormalities of tongue movement.) Do this twice.\n8. Ask the patient to tap his or her thumb with each finger as rapidly as possible for 10 to 15 seconds, first with right hand, then with left hand. (Observe facial and leg movements.)\n9. Flex and extend the patient’s left and right arms, one at a time.\n10. Ask the patient to stand up. (Observe the patient in profile. Observe all body areas again, hips included.)\n11. Ask the patient to extend both arms out in front, palms down. (Observe trunk, legs, and mouth.)\n12.

<string name="bprse_q22_title">BPRS-E: 22. Distractibility</string>
<string name="bprse_q22_question">(Rate items 15–24 on the basis of observed behaviour and speech.)\n\nDegree to which observed sequences of speech and actions are interrupted by stimuli unrelated to the interview. Distractibility is rated when the individual shows a change in the focus of attention as characterised by a pause in speech or a marked shift in gaze. Individual’s attention may be drawn to noise in adjoining room, books on a shelf, interviewer’s clothing, etc. Do not rate circumstantiality, tangentiality or flight of ideas. Also, do not rate rumination with delusional material. Rate even if the distracting stimulus cannot be identified.</string>
<string name="bprse_q22_s">Q22 (distractibility):</string>
<string name="bprse_q22_option2">2 – Very mild. Generally can focus on interviewer’s questions with only 1 distraction or inappropriate shift of attention of brief duration.</string>
<string name="bprse_q22_option3">3 – Mild. Individual shifts focus of attention to matters unrelated to the interview 2–3 times.</string>
<string name="bprse_q22_option4">4 – Moderate. Often responsive to irrelevant stimuli in the room, e.g., averts gaze from the interviewer.</string>
<string name="bprse_q22_option5">5 – Moderately severe. Same as above, but now distractibility clearly interferes with the flow of the interview.</string>
<string name="bprse_q22_option6">6 – Severe. Extremely difficult to conduct interview or pursue a topic due to preoccupation with irrelevant stimuli.</string>
<string name="bprse_q22_option7">7 – Extremely severe. Impossible to conduct interview due to preoccupation with irrelevant stimuli.</string>
<string name="bprse_q23_title">BPRS-E: 23. Motor hyperactivity</string>
<string name="bprse_q23_question">(Rate items 15–24 on the basis of observed behaviour and speech.)\n\nIncrease in energy level evidenced in more frequent movement and/or rapid speech. Do not rate if restlessness is due to akathisia.</string>
<string name="bprse_q23_s">Q23 (hyperactivity):</string>
<string name="bprse_q23_option2">2 – Very mild. Some restlessness, difficulty sitting still, lively facial expressions, or somewhat talkative.</string>
<string name="bprse_q23_option3">3 – Mild. Occasionally very restless, definite increase in motor activity, lively gestures, 1–3 brief instances of pressured speech.</string>
<string name="bprse_q23_option4">4 – Moderate. Very restless, fidgety, excessive facial expressions, or non-productive and repetitious motor movements. Much pressured speech, up to one-third of the interview.</string>
<string name="bprse_q23_option5">5 – Moderately severe. Frequently restless, fidgety. Many instances of excessive nonproductive and repetitious motor movements. On the move most of the time. Frequent pressured speech, difficult to interrupt. Rises on 1–2 occasions to pace.</string>
<string name="bprse_q23_option6">6 – Severe. Excessive motor activity, restlessness, fidgety, loud tapping, noisy, etc., throughout most of the interview. Speech can only be interrupted with much effort. Rises on 3–4 occasions to pace.</string>
<string name="bprse_q23_option7">7 – Extremely severe. Constant excessive motor activity throughout entire interview, e.g., constant pacing, constant pressured speech with no pauses, individual can only be interrupted briefly and only small amounts of relevant information can be obtained.</string>
<string name="bprse_q24_title">BPRS-E: 24. Mannerisms and posturing</string>
<string name="bprse_q24_question">(Rate items 15–24 on the basis of observed behaviour and speech.)\n\nUnusual and bizarre behaviour, stylised movements or acts, or any postures which are clearly uncomfortable or inappropriate. Exclude obvious manifestations of medication side effects. Do not include nervous mannerisms that are not odd or unusual.</string>
<string name="bprse_q24_s">Q24 (mannerisms/posturing):</string>
<string name="bprse_q24_option2">2 – Very mild. Eccentric or odd mannerisms or activity that ordinary persons would have difficulty explaining, e.g., grimacing, picking. Observed once for a brief period.</string>
<string name="bprse_q24_option3">3 – Mild. Same as 2, but occurring on two occasions of brief duration.</string>
<string name="bprse_q24_option4">4 – Moderate. Mannerisms or posturing, e.g., stylised movements or acts, rocking, nodding, rubbing, or grimacing, observed on several occasions for brief periods or infrequently but very odd. For example, uncomfortable posture maintained for 5 seconds more than twice. </string>
<string name="bprse_q24_option5">5 – Moderately severe. Same as 4, but occurring often, or several examples of very odd mannerisms or posturing that are idiosyncratic to the individual.</string>
<string name="bprse_q24_option6">6 – Severe. Frequent stereotyped behaviour, assumes and maintains uncomfortable or inappropriate postures, intense rocking, smearing, strange rituals or foetal posturing. Individual can interact with people and the environment for brief periods despite these behaviours.</string>
<string name="bprse_q24_option7">7 – Extremely severe. Same as 6, but individual cannot interact with people or the environment due to these behaviours.</string>

<string name="caps_instruction_2">This questionnaire asks questions about sensations and perceptions you may have experienced. Some of the experiences are unusual, some of them are more everyday.</string>
<string name="caps_instruction_3">We realise selecting answers may not always represent your experience as accurately as you might like. However, we would ask you to select the answers that most closely match your experience and avoid missing any questions out.</string>
<string name="caps_instruction_4">We would appreciate it if you could be as honest as possible when giving your answers.</string>
<string name="caps_instruction_5">The only experiences we are not interested in are those that may have occurred whilst under the influence of drugs.</string>
<string name="caps_instruction_6">Instructions</string>
<string name="caps_instruction_7">Each item has a question. Please read the question and select either YES or NO.</string> <!-- original: "a question on the left hand side" -->

<string name="honos65_q11">11. Problems with living conditions\n\n• Rate the overall severity of problems with the quality of living conditions, accommodation and daily domestic routine, taking into account the patient’s preferences and degree of satisfaction with circumstances.\n• Are the basic necessities met (heat, light, hygiene)? If so, does the physical environment contribute to maximising independence and minimising risk, and provide a choice of opportunities to facilitate the use of existing skills and develop new ones?\n• Do not rate the level of functional disability itself, rated at Scale 10.\n\nNB: Rate patient’s usual accommodation. If in acute ward, rate the home accommodation. If information not obtainable, rate 9.</string>
<string name="honos65_q11_s">Q11 (living conditions):</string>
<string name="honos65_q11_option0">0 – Accommodation and living conditions are acceptable; helpful in keeping any disability rated at Scale 10 to the lowest level possible and minimising any risk, and supportive of self-help; the patient is satisfied with their accommodation.</string>
<string name="honos65_q11_option1">1 – Accommodation is reasonably acceptable with only minor or transient problems related primarily to the patient’s preferences rather than any significant problems or risks associated with their environment (e.g., not ideal location, not preferred option, doesn’t like food).</string>
<string name="honos65_q11_option2">2 – Basics are met but significant problems with one or more aspects of the accommodation or regime (e.g., lack of proper adaptation to optimise function relating for instance to stairs, lifts or other problems of access); may be associated with risk to patient (e.g., injury) which would otherwise be reduced.</string>
<string name="honos65_q11_option3">3 – Distressing multiple problems with accommodation; e.g., some basic necessities are absent (unsatisfactory or unreliable heating, lack of proper cooking facilities, inadequate sanitation); clear elements of risk to the patient resulting from aspects of the physical environment.</string>
<string name="honos65_q11_option4">4 – Accommodation is unacceptable: e.g., lack of basic necessities, insecure, or living conditions are otherwise intolerable, contributing adversely to the patient’s condition or placing them at high risk of injury or other adverse consequences.</string>
<string name="honos65_q12">12. Problems with occupation and activities\n\n• Rate the overall level of problems with quality of daytime environment. Is there help to cope with disabilities, and opportunities for maintaining or improving occupational and recreational skills and activities? Consider factors such as stigma, lack of qualified staff, lack of access to supportive facilities, e.g., staffing and equipment of day centres, social clubs, etc.\n• Do not rate the level of functional disability itself, rated at Scale 10.\n\nNB: Rate the patient’s usual situation. If in acute ward, rate activities during period before admission. If information not available, rate 9.</string>
<string name="honos65_q12_s">Q12 (occupation/activities):</string>
<string name="honos65_q12_option0">0 – Patient’s day–time environment is acceptable; helpful in keeping any disability rated at Scale 10 to the lowest level possible, and maximising autonomy.</string>
<string name="honos65_q12_option1">1 – Minor or temporary problems, e.g., good facilities available but not always at appropriate times for the patient.</string>
<string name="honos65_q12_option2">2 – Limited choice of activities; e.g., insufficient carer or professional support, useful day setting available but for very limited hours.</string>
<string name="honos65_q12_option3">3 – Marked deficiency in skilled services and support available to help optimise activity level and autonomy, little opportunity to use skills or to develop new ones; unskilled care difficult to access.</string>
<string name="honos65_q12_option4">4 – Lack of any effective opportunity for daytime activities makes the patient’s problems worse or patient refuses services offered which might improve their situation.</string>

<string name="icd10pd_general">General criteria for personality disorders (F60)</string>
<string name="icd10pd_G1">G1 [PATHOLOGICAL 1]. Evidence that the individual’s characteristic and enduring patterns of inner experience and behaviour deviate markedly as a whole from the culturally expected and accepted range (or ‘norm’).</string>
<string name="icd10pd_G1b">Such deviation must be manifest in more than one of the following areas:</string>
<string name="icd10pd_G1_1">(1) cognition (i.e. ways of perceiving and interpreting things, people and events; forming attitudes and images of self and others)</string>
<string name="icd10pd_G1_2">(2) affectivity (range, intensity and appropriateness of emotional arousal and response)</string>
<string name="icd10pd_G1_3">(3) control over impulses and need gratification</string>
<string name="icd10pd_G1_4">(4) relating to others and manner of handling interpersonal situations</string>
<string name="icd10pd_G2">G2 [PERVASIVE]. The deviation must manifest itself pervasively as behaviour that is inflexible, maladaptive, or otherwise dysfunctional across a broad range of personal and social situations (i.e. not being limited to one specific ‘triggering’ stimulus or situation).</string>
<string name="icd10pd_G3">G3 [PATHOLOGICAL 2]. There is personal distress, or adverse impact on the social environment, or both, clearly attributable to the behaviour referred to under G2.</string>
<string name="icd10pd_G4">G4 [PERSISTENT]. There must be evidence that the deviation is stable and of long duration, having its onset in late childhood or adolescence.</string>
<string name="icd10pd_G5">G5 [PRIMARY 1]. The deviation cannot be explained as a manifestation or consequence of other adult mental disorders, although episodic or chronic conditions from sections F0 to F7 of this classification may co-exist, or be superimposed on it.</string>
<string name="icd10pd_G6">G6 [PRIMARY 2]. Organic brain disease, injury, or dysfunction must be excluded as possible cause of the deviation (if such organic causation is demonstrable, use category F07).</string>
<string name="icd10pd_comments">The assessment of G1 to G6 above should be based on as many sources of information as possible. Although sometimes it is possible to obtain sufficient evidence from a single interview with the subject, as a general rule it is recommended to have more than one interview with the person and to collect history data from informants or past records.</string>
